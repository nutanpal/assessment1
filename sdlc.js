// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


SDLC Steps: 
1. Planning, 
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintain 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisRequirements =
  "In Second step, buisness analysis is done to define and clearly document product requirements and compiled in SRS(Software requirement specification)stating what all product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.This also compile requirements for quality assurance,technical feasibillity and risk analysis for the software to work.";

const design =
  "In 3rd phase, tech architect and lead developer creat dds(dds: design document specifications) having high level design framework and more than one poposed design approach. DDS is reviewed by all stakeholders and best architecture for product finalized based on parameters like time, budget,product robustness,design modularity and risk assessments.";

const implementation =
  "This is the 4th step where developers actually build and develop the product based on DDS.Coding guidelines of organization are followed, programming tools like compilers, interpreters and debuggers and high level programming languages like C,C++, Pascal, Java,PHP used for coding. Language preference is according to the type of software being developed. ";

const testingIntegration =
  "In the 5th stage, Product testing done for reporting defects, tracking, fixing and retesting untill it passes the quality standards defined in SRS.";

const maintain =
  " After testing the product is deployed in market finally. Sometimes it is released in limited segment first for testing in real business environment(UAT- user accepatance testing).Based on feedback the enhanced product is finally released  and its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.";
